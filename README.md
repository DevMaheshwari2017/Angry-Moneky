# Angry Monkey

**Inspiration:** Inspired by Balloon TD6

Angry Monkey is a tower defense game that draws inspiration from the popular Balloon TD6. The game challenges players to strategically place towers to defend against waves of enemies. However, what sets Angry Monkey apart is its robust use of the Dependency Injection (DI) design pattern throughout its code architecture.

## Dependency Injection in Angry Monkey:

At its core, Dependency Injection is a programming paradigm that revolves around the idea of inverting control. In simpler terms, it's a practice of providing the necessary dependencies (like classes or services) to a component from the outside, rather than letting the component create them itself.

  ### Benefits of Using Dependency Injection:

  **1. Improved Reusability:** Components are more modular and can be reused across different parts of 
  the game.
   
  **2. Improved Testability:** Dependencies can be easily mocked or stubbed, making unit testing more 
  straightforward.
   
  **3. Improved Maintainability:** Changes to dependencies require minimal changes to the components 
  that use them.
   
  **4. Decreased Coupling:** Reduces the tight coupling between classes and their dependencies, 
  leading to a more flexible and scalable codebase.
   
## Challenges and Learning:

Implementing Dependency Injection in Angry Monkey was both a challenge and a significant learning experience. It required a deep understanding of the DI pattern and its application within Unity. The process involved:

  * Designing the game architecture to support DI.

  * Refactoring existing code to decouple dependencies.

  * Ensuring that all game components received their dependencies from an external source.

Through this project, I gained valuable insights into the benefits and practical applications of Dependency Injection, which has greatly enhanced my skills in creating maintainable and scalable game architectures.

## Conclusion:

Angry Monkey is not just a fun and engaging tower defense game but also a testament to the power of modern design patterns like Dependency Injection. The project showcases how thoughtful architecture can lead to improved code quality and a better overall development experience.
